Welcome to Computer Science!
----------------------------

Please review the User Agreement available at our website at:
 - http://www.ucalgary.ca/cpsc/tech/agreement

If you are new to Linux/Unix, a quick overview of common UNIX commands is 
available at our website at: 
 - http://www.ucalgary.ca/cpsc/tech/educational_resources/unix_commands


Account Disk Quotas
-------------------

Quotas only apply to undergraduate students.

If you are an undergraduate, your account comes with 1 GB of disk space, more 
depending on the type and number of courses you are taking. If you feel that 
you require more space for your course work, please contact us at 
 - help@cpsc.ucalgary.ca

If you are over the hard limits of your quota, you will be unable to login. You
may determine where your space is consumed by running on the terminal:

  du -sk * .??* | sort -rn | head

or use the disk space analyzer that is installed on each system (baobab)


CPSC Printing
-------------

If you are an undergraduate, you may print to the undergraduate printers in 
the main CPSC labs at the first floor of MS. You must release your print 
jobs at the release stations before your print job gets printed.

Undergraduate accounts are provided with 50 pages per CPSC course taken this
semester for free. Additional pages will not be available. Once you have
exhausted your pages, you will need to print using UCIT's printers using the
balance on your OneCard.

To see the number of pages available to you, open The CPSC Guide program or
execute `lpinfo` in the command line.

A banner page will be printed by default for each print job sent to our printer.
This can be disabled using The CPSC Guide program or manually by creating an 
empty file '.nowinbanner' in your home directory by running:

  touch ~/.nowinbanner


CPSC Account Deactivation
-------------------------

CPSC accounts will be deactivated after the completion of your course or program,
depending on your enrollment status:

+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Enrollment Status           | Account Removal                          |
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| CPSC Majors and Minors      | 8 months after last active semester      |
| Not CPSC Majors or Minors   | 4 months after last CPSC course          |
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+

You will receive an email to your official @ucalgary.ca email address one
month before your account will be deactivated. 

Your UCIT account will not be affected.


File Restore
------------

Your account data will be backed up nightly. If you wish to recover a deleted
file, please contact us with both the date and file path. A file recovery may
take up to a full business day.


Getting Help & Feedback
-----------------------

We appreciate bug reports, package requests, or comments and feedback via email
